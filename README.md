# mockbrew - Craft APIs Faster Than Brewing Coffee

Mockbrew is a mock server designed to help you develop REST APIs without being
an hinderance to the development process. The Mockbrew app is a real-time
development engine which does not require you to operate this server rather
makes use of our existing OS file system to interact with your mocks.
